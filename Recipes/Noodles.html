    <h1> Directions</h1>
    <p><Strong>Step 1:</Strong></p>
    <p>Assemble your ingredients. You'll need a pack of instant noodles, water, a microwave, and your kitchen confidence (or lack thereof). Forget the fancy chef's hat; a goofy grin will suffice.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p> Find a microwave-safe bowl. You don't want to risk turning your microwave into a science experiment. A bowl that's larger than your head is a solid choice.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Tear open the noodle pack. Be careful, it's like the noodles are holding a grudge. Don't let those little curly guys escape!</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>ump the noodles into the microwave-safe bowl. It's important to do this with the utmost precision, or else you might end up with noodles all over the place.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>
    <p>Now, add water. The exact amount isn't super important; just fill it up enough to cover the noodles, like you're giving them a cozy, steamy bath.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong></p>
    <p>Give the noodles a little stir. This is their spa day, after all. You want to make sure they're fully immersed in the hot tub.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>
    <p> Place the bowl in the microwave. Make sure the noodles are comfortable; they're about to get a bit of a shock. Close the door, but don't make it sound like a prison sentence – microwave for a few minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8:</strong></p>
    <p>While waiting, engage in a "microwave dance." Trust me; it's the secret ingredient that makes instant noodles taste better.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
    <p>Once the microwave bell chimes, don't scream like it's the finale of your favorite TV show. Carefully remove the bowl, and please, use oven mitts to avoid those noodle-induced burns.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 10</strong></p>
    <p>Let it cool for a minute or two. Instant noodles can be a bit clingy when they're hot, so give them some space to cool off and reflect on their life choices.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 11:</strong></p>
    <p>Now, slurp them up like a pro. But be careful – this is a high-risk noodle operation. Slurp too fast, and you might inhale them. Slurp too slow, and they may go cold and get all mushy. Balance is key!
    You've successfully made instant noodles without burning down your kitchen or launching them into outer space</p>
